## Getting Started

To generate your bills, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository:** Start by cloning this repository to your local machine.
    
2.  **Compile the Code:** Use your favorite Java compiler to compile the code.
    
3.  **Prepare Your Template:** Ensure you have a base PDF file that will act as the template for your bills. Make sure it contains the necessary placeholders for the text elements you want to insert dynamically.
    
4.  **Create JSON Data:** Craft a JSON file containing the text details, positions, font styles, and colors for each element you want to place on the bill. Refer to the provided example JSON file for guidance.
    
5.  **Run the Application:** Use the command-line interface to specify the required options, including the template name, JSON input file, and the output PDF file path. For example:
    
 ```shell
 java -jar billGenerator.jar -t ./data/base-pdf/bill-template.pdf -j ./data/json/bill-data.json -o ./output/bill.pdf
 ``` 
    
6.  **Voila!** Your customized bill will be generated and saved at the specified output location.
    

## Example JSON Data

The JSON file should contain an array of objects, each representing a text element to be placed on the bill. Here's an example:

```json

[
  {
    "text": "Your Company Name",
    "locationX": 50,
    "locationY": 100,
    "fontSize": 14,
    "color": "#336699",
    "font": "Roboto-Bold.ttf"
  },
  {
    "text": "Invoice Number: 123456",
    "locationX": 60,
    "locationY": 200,
    "fontSize": 11,
    "color": "#444444",
    "font": "Helvetica-Regular.ttf"
  },
  {
    "text": "Total Amount: $100.00",
    "locationX": 80,
    "locationY": 250,
    "fontSize": 12,
    "color": "#222222",
    "font": "Arial-Bold.ttf"
  },
  {
    "enricher": "RandomNumber",
    "locationX": 125,
    "locationY": 300,
    "fontSize": 11,
    "color": "#222222",
    "font": "VictorMono-Bold.ttf"
  }
]
```

In this example, the JSON data instructs the tool to place various texts at specific positions on the bill and apply different font styles and colors.
