## Overview

The Bill Generator is a powerful Java-based tool that allows you to effortlessly generate bills using a base PDF file as a template and a JSON data file to define the text placement. Whether you're running a small business, managing finances for a project, or just need to create customized bills, this tool has got you covered!

## Features

-   **Easy to Use:** With a simple command-line interface, you can quickly generate bills without any hassle.
    
-   **Customizable Templates:** The tool utilizes a base PDF file as a template, giving you complete freedom to design your bill's layout. Just create your perfect template once, and you're ready to generate countless customized bills.
    
-   **JSON Data Integration:** Simply provide a JSON file with the required text details and their respective positions on the bill. The tool will seamlessly merge the data with the template, saving you valuable time.
    
-   **Font and Styling Options:** Customize the appearance of your bills with various font styles, colors, and font sizes to make them look professional and appealing.
    

## Getting Started

To generate your bills, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository:** Start by cloning this repository to your local machine.
    
2.  **Compile the Code:** Use your favorite Java compiler to compile the code.
    
3.  **Prepare Your Template:** Ensure you have a base PDF file that will act as the template for your bills. Make sure it contains the necessary placeholders for the text elements you want to insert dynamically.
    
4.  **Create JSON Data:** Craft a JSON file containing the text details, positions, font styles, and colors for each element you want to place on the bill. Refer to the provided example JSON file for guidance.
    
5.  **Run the Application:** Use the command-line interface to specify the required options, including the template name, JSON input file, and the output PDF file path. For example:
    
 ```shell
 java -jar billGenerator.jar -t ./data/base-pdf/bill-template.pdf -j ./data/json/bill-data.json -o ./output/bill.pdf
 ``` 
    
6.  **Voila!** Your customized bill will be generated and saved at the specified output location.
    

## Example JSON Data

The JSON file should contain an array of objects, each representing a text element to be placed on the bill. Here's an example:

```json

[
  {
    "text": "Your Company Name",
    "locationX": 50,
    "locationY": 100,
    "fontSize": 14,
    "color": "#336699",
    "font": "Roboto-Bold.ttf"
  },
  {
    "text": "Invoice Number: 123456",
    "locationX": 60,
    "locationY": 200,
    "fontSize": 11,
    "color": "#444444",
    "font": "Helvetica-Regular.ttf"
  },
  {
    "text": "Total Amount: $100.00",
    "locationX": 80,
    "locationY": 250,
    "fontSize": 12,
    "color": "#222222",
    "font": "Arial-Bold.ttf"
  },
  {
    "enricher": "RandomNumber",
    "locationX": 125,
    "locationY": 300,
    "fontSize": 11,
    "color": "#222222",
    "font": "VictorMono-Bold.ttf"
  }
]
```

In this example, the JSON data instructs the tool to place various texts at specific positions on the bill and apply different font styles and colors.

## Extensibility using Enrichers

The Bill Generator is designed to be highly extensible, allowing users to enhance its functionality by incorporating custom enrichers. Enrichers are small modules that generate dynamic text values based on specific rules or calculations. As an example, let's explore the built-in `RandomNumber`, `DateToday`, and `TimeNow` enrichers, and then see how you can easily create your own enrichers.

### Built-in Enrichers

#### RandomNumber

The `RandomNumber` enricher generates a random 10-digit number, which can be useful for creating unique identifiers such as invoice numbers or bill numbers. In the example JSON file, you can see the `RandomNumber` enricher in action:

```json
{
  "enricher": "RandomNumber",
  "locationX": 125,
  "locationY": 300,
  "fontSize": 11,
  "color": "#222222",
  "font": "VictorMono-Bold.ttf"
}
```

This enricher will produce a random 10-digit number at the specified location on the PDF bill.

#### DateToday

The `DateToday` enricher generates the current date in the desired format. You can use it to automatically add the current date to your bills. To use the `DateToday` enricher, you would modify your JSON data like this:

jsonCopy code

```json
{
  "text": "DateToday",
  "locationX": 80,
  "locationY": 260,
  "fontSize": 11,
  "color": "#444444",
  "font": "Helvetica-Regular.ttf"
}
``` 

When processed, the `DateToday` enricher will insert the current date in the format "dd/MM/yyyy" at the specified location.

#### TimeNow

The `TimeNow` enricher works similarly to the `DateToday` enricher, but it generates the current time. Here's an example of how to use it in your JSON data:

jsonCopy code

```json
{
  "text": "Time: @TimeNow(HH:mm:ss)",
  "locationX": 80,
  "locationY": 280,
  "fontSize": 11,
  "color": "#444444",
  "font": "Helvetica-Regular.ttf"
}
``` 

This will place the current time in the format "HH:mm:ss" on your bill.

### Creating Custom Enrichers

The true power of the Bill Generator lies in its extensibility, allowing you to create custom enrichers tailored to your specific needs. To create a new enricher, follow these steps:

1.  Implement the `IEnricher` Interface: Start by creating a new Java class that implements the `IEnricher` interface. This interface ensures that your enricher will have the necessary methods for processing and retrieving the enricher's name.
    
2.  Annotate with `@Enricher`: Add the `@Enricher` annotation to your custom enricher class. This annotation marks the class as an enricher, allowing the Bill Generator to identify and utilize it.
    
3.  Define the Enricher's Functionality: Within your enricher class, define the logic to generate the dynamic text you want to insert into the bill. In the example below, we'll create an enricher that generates a random discount percentage:
    

```java

package com.amithgc.billgenerator.enricher;

import com.amithgc.billgenerator.enricher.utils.Enricher;

import java.util.Random;

@Enricher
public class RandomDiscountEnricher implements IEnricher {
    @Override
    public String getName() {
        return "RandomDiscount";
    }

    @Override
    public String process() {
        return String.format("%.2f", generateRandomDiscount());
    }

    private double generateRandomDiscount() {
        Random random = new Random();
        return random.nextDouble() * 50; // Generates a random discount between 0 and 50%
    }
}
``` 

4.  Utilize the Custom Enricher: Once you've created your custom enricher, you can use it in your JSON data just like the built-in enrichers:

jsonCopy code

```json
{
  "text": "RandomDiscount",
  "locationX": 80,
  "locationY": 320,
  "fontSize": 11,
  "color": "#444444",
  "font": "Helvetica-Regular.ttf"
}
``` 

This example will apply your custom enricher, `RandomDiscount`, to generate a random discount percentage and display it on the bill.

With the ability to create custom enrichers, the possibilities for dynamically generating content in your bills become limitless. Get creative and build enrichers to suit your unique requirements!
